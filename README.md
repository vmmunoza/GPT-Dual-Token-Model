This repo contains the analysis made by GPT-4 on the Yeti-Apes build scope document.

To ensure the development document provides a comprehensive guide for developers to implement the smart contracts exactly as needed for your dual-token model and profit sharing mechanism, itâ€™s crucial to address several areas comprehensively. Here are some aspects that might be lacking or need further detailing in the document:

### 1. **Detailed Governance Mechanisms**
   - **Voting System**: Define how token holders will use their $YOINTS to vote on decisions. Include details on voting rights per token, minimum tokens needed to propose changes, and how proposals are submitted and processed.
   - **Snapshot Integrations**: If the document mentions using snapshot strategies for voting, include specifics on how snapshots are taken, stored, and used in governance decisions.

### 2. **Comprehensive Reward Mechanisms**
   - **Dynamic Reward Adjustments**: Specify if and how rewards adjust based on token supply, staking durations, or other metrics to maintain sustainability as the ecosystem grows.
   - **Reward Distribution Schedule**: Provide clear formulas or algorithms that dictate how rewards are calculated and distributed, including any factors that might affect these calculations (e.g., total staked amount, individual stake duration).

### 3. **Security Features and Considerations**
   - **Audit Trails**: Ensure there is a requirement for security audits in the document, detailing who should perform these audits, what areas they should focus on, and how often they should occur.
   - **Smart Contract Upgrades**: Detail the upgrade process for smart contracts, especially for critical contracts like those handling staking and rewards. Specify how upgrades are approved and executed to ensure continuity and security.
   - **Emergency Protocols**: Outline specific steps and permissions for triggering emergency functions like `EmergencyWithdrawRewards` and `EmergencyUnlock`. Specify the conditions under which these may be used.

### 4. **Integration Points and External Dependencies**
   - **External Contracts and Interfaces**: Clearly list all external contracts and APIs the system will interact with, such as decentralized exchanges or other DeFi platforms. Include specifications for these integrations.
   - **Data Feeds and Oracles**: If the system relies on external data for functions like pricing tokens or determining reward values, specify what data is needed and which oracles will be used.

### 5. **Front-End Interactions and User Interface Requirements**
   - **User Actions and Feedback**: Detail the user actions required at each step (e.g., staking, voting, claiming rewards) and the corresponding system feedback or UI update.
   - **Error Handling**: Define how errors will be communicated to users and what error recovery processes should be in place.

### 6. **Legal and Compliance Considerations**
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Address any compliance issues relevant to the jurisdictions in which the tokens will be available. This may include details on KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, anti-money laundering (AML) practices, and other regulatory requirements.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Include guidelines on how tax reporting and withholding will be handled, especially for profit-sharing mechanisms.

### 7. **Detailed Technical Specifications**
   - **Contract Specifications**: Provide precise technical details for each contract, including state variables, functions, modifiers, and events.
   - **System Architecture Diagrams**: Include detailed diagrams that illustrate how all parts of the system (contracts, user interfaces, external integrations) interact.

Ensuring these elements are thoroughly defined will not only aid developers in implementing the contracts correctly but also help in maintaining the system's integrity, scalability, and compliance over time. Consider gathering feedback from technical leads, auditors, and potential users to identify any other gaps in the document.
