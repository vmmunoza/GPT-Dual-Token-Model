# Overview:

To implement a profit-sharing mechanism efficiently within your dual-token model, you need a contract or a set of contracts that can handle the collection and distribution of fees generated by transactions within the ecosystem. Here's an outline of what such a mechanism could look like, along with a basic example:

### Components of a Profit Sharing Mechanism
1. **Fee Collection**: A mechanism to collect a percentage of transaction fees or product usage fees in $YAPES and potentially other tokens like $METIS.
2. **Fee Pool**: Accumulation of collected fees in a designated wallet or contract.
3. **Distribution Logic**: Automatic distribution of accumulated fees to $YOINTS stakers based on their stake percentages or another predefined distribution formula.
4. **Distribution Trigger**: Scheduled or condition-based triggers for distributing the collected fees.

### Example Smart Contract for Profit Sharing

Below is a simplified Solidity contract that demonstrates how to collect fees and distribute them to token holders. This example assumes that fees are collected in Ether, but it can be adapted for other tokens by changing the payment method to ERC-20 token transfers.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract ProfitSharing is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    IERC20 public yointsToken;
    uint256 public totalDistributed;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastClaimed;

    constructor(address _yointsToken) {
        yointsToken = IERC20(_yointsToken);
    }

    // Function to distribute profits to stakers
    function distributeProfits() public onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance; // Assume all Ether in contract is to be distributed
        require(balance > 0, "No profits to distribute");

        uint256 totalStakes = yointsToken.totalSupply(); // Assuming all tokens are staked
        for (uint i = 0; i < stakers.length; i++) {
            address staker = stakers[i];
            uint256 stake = yointsToken.balanceOf(staker); // Get the stake of each holder
            uint256 payment = balance * stake / totalStakes;
            payable(staker).transfer(payment);
            lastClaimed[staker] = block.timestamp;
        }
        totalDistributed += balance;
    }

    // Allow contract to receive Ether for profit distribution
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

### Points to Consider
- **Security**: Ensure the distribution mechanism is secure against attacks like reentrancy and rounding errors.
- **Efficiency**: Consider gas costs, especially when iterating over a potentially large number of stakers. Techniques like Merkle Distributor or off-chain calculations with on-chain verification can be employed.
- **Flexibility**: The system should be able to handle different types of fees and adapt to changes in fee structures or tokenomics.
- **Compliance and Transparency**: Ensure that the mechanism complies with relevant regulations and offers transparency in how profits are collected and distributed.

To implement these functionalities fully, detailed specifications about transaction flows, fee percentages, and stakeholder roles are necessary. If these details are not fully fleshed out in your current documents, they should be specified to avoid any ambiguities during development.
